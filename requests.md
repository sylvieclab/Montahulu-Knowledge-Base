# How to Request Media

Use our Discord bot commands to request movies and TV shows. Your requests will be automatically processed and added to the Plex library!

## 📺 Request Commands

There are two simple commands for requesting content:

**`/request sd-hd-movie title`** - Request a movie by title  
**`/request sd-hd-tv title`** - Request a TV show by title

Simply type the command and enter the movie or show name!

## 📋 Request Process

Here's what happens when you submit a request:

1. Submit your request using one of the commands above
2. The request will begin downloading automatically
3. You'll receive a ping in **#request-status** when it's ready
4. Once Plex picks it up, you'll see it in **#recently-added**
5. Start watching on Plex!

## ⏱️ How Long Does It Take?

Download times vary based on file size and server load. Most content is available within a few hours. 

Check **#request-status** for updates on your specific request.

## 💡 Tips for Better Results

- **Be specific with titles** - Include the year if there are multiple movies with the same name
- **TV shows** - You'll be prompted to select which season(s) you want
- **Already requested?** - Check **#request-status** first to avoid duplicates
- **Can't find it?** - Ask in **#general-chat** for help

## ⚠️ Please Be Respectful

Storage is expensive! Please be mindful of what you request:

- Only request content you actually plan to watch
- Check if it's already available in the library first
- Consider requesting individual seasons instead of entire series if you're not sure you'll watch it all
- Be patient with large requests
